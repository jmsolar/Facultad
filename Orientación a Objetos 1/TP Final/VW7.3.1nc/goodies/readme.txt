VisualWorks(R) 7.3 "Goodies" ReadMe
Copyright 1999-2004 Cincom Systems, Inc.  All rights reserved.


Goodies are extensions to VisualWorks.  They provide a wide variety
features, including frameworks for various programming tasks,
additional database support for StORE, tools, free versions of third-
party software, and so on.  Some goodies include documentation
provided by their developers; many do not.

See /vw7.3/filelist.txt for one-line descriptions of the included
files.

Goodies in the "other" subdirectory are 3rd party goodies in the public
domain that we think are either very useful or fun.  Goodies in the
"parc" directory are developed by members of the VisualWorks team, and
are sometimes on their way to being added to the product (someday).

Note: All goodies are provided without warranty and without support.
Use them at your own discretion and risk.
