This is version 1.3-014 of the PostgreSQL Library for VisualWorks Smalltalk.
Tested with VisualWorks 7.x & PostgreSQL 7.4.x

This file is intended to be viewed from a VisualWorks text editor.  Tabbing may look wierd otherwise.

The library is made up of five parcels:

	PostgreSQLVWCompatibility -		A mapping library containing wrappers for
									base code which has different implementation
									in different Smalltalk dialects.
	PostgreSQLDriver -				The (hopefuly) dialect independent driver layer.
	PostgreSQLLogging -			Support for logging (tracing) message traffic between
									the driver running in a client and the PostgreSQL 
									backend.
	Base64Encoding - 				An implementation of the Base64 MIME encoding
									used to manipulate BLOB type data.
	PostgreSQLEXDI - 				Mapping from the VisualWorks EXDI layer to the
									driver layer.
	StoreForPostgreSQL - 			Enables the use of the Store SCM with PostgreSQL
									using the EXDI & driver layers.


To get started, load the parcels and look at the class side test methods of:
	PostgreSQLTest in the parcel PostgreSQLDriver
	PostgreSQLEXDITest in the parcel PostgreSQLEXDI
	PostgreSQLLoggingTesting in the logging parcel

Have a look at the parcel comments for each parcel.

Visit http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/VisualWorks/PostgreSQL+Libraries for documentation (including how to obtain and install PostgreSQL itself) and recent news.

NOTE: The PostgreSQL monitor parcel contains an experimental UI for monitoring PostgreSQL connections.  Use with care, and comment freely :-)
