The logging facilities of the PostgreSQL driver make it possible to capture detailed information about the messages that flow between the driver and the PostgreSQL backend services.

A PostgreSQLConnectionLog captures the message traffic from one or more connections and writes the details to a stream. 

To create a PostgreSQLConnectionLog to monitor a single connection, use:
		PostgreSQLConnectionLog logEverythingFor: <connection> to: <write stream>

To create a PostgreSQLConnectionLog to monitor all connections, use:
		PostgreSQLConnectionLog logEverythingTo: <write stream>

Note that using a PostgreSQLConnectionLog will create huge amounts of information, and will have a negative impact on the performance ot the connection(s) being monitored.  Make sure you have plenty of space (memory / disk space) to hold your logs.

Future versions of the logging facility will allow only specific kinds of message to be logged.
